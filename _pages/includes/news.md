# ðŸ”¥ News
- *2025.10*: We propose Video-STAR, a powerful Tool-Augmented Agentic RL approach for Thinking with Videos. On open-vocabulary action recognition benchmarks like K-400 and HMDB-51, our 3B VLM achieves nearly 40% accuracy improvement over base models! 
- *2025.09*: ur work HALF-GS, an efficient dynamic 3D reconstruction framework combining sparse anchors, self-supervised guidance, and hierarchical propagation to improve reconstruction quality and temporal consistency, has been accepted by NeurIPS 2025!
